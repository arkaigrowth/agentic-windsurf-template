# AI Documentation

This directory contains documentation specifically structured for AI consumption. The goal is to provide clear, structured information that AI assistants can easily understand and leverage when helping with development tasks.

## Purpose
These documents serve as a knowledge base for both humans and AI assistants, containing:
- API specifications and integration details
- Architectural decisions and system design
- Technical details and implementation notes
- Domain-specific knowledge

## For Humans
When adding new documentation:
1. Use clear, structured headings
2. Include code examples where applicable
3. Define technical terms and acronyms
4. Link to external resources when appropriate

## For AI Assistants
When working with this documentation:
1. Reference these documents when making implementation suggestions
2. Help maintain and update these documents as the project evolves
3. Suggest additions when you notice knowledge gaps

## Note on MCP Integration
Information gathered via MCP servers (e.g., `fetch` for API docs) can be summarized and stored here for persistent project knowledge. This creates a curated knowledge base that combines external information with project-specific context.

## Contents
- `example_external_api.md`: Example documentation for an external API
- `project_architecture_v1.md`: High-level architecture documentation
