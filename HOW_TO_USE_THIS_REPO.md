# HOW TO USE THIS REPO

Alas... you've watched YT videos until your eyes hurt, and you've made it to fully automated luxury agentic software development (just mind your API U$$$AGE!! ðŸ˜¬)

## The TL;DR

This repo gives you a ready-to-roll project structure for building apps with AI assistance. It's like pair programming, but your partner is an AI that actually knows what it's doing.

## Quick Setup (no cap)

1. **Clone this repo** to your machine (or just copy these files)
```
git clone [your-repo-url]
```

2. **Rename everything** from "agentic_project" to whatever your actual project is called
```
# Example (macOS/Linux)
find . -type f -exec sed -i '' 's/agentic_project/your_cool_project/g' {} \;
```

3. **Set up your Windsurf config** to use those MCP servers (if you haven't already)
   - Make sure your `mcp.json` is good to go
   - Double-check your API keys aren't expired

## How to Actually Use This Thing

### The Workflow Vibe Check

1. **Prime your AI** with project context
   - Grab the template from `.windsurf_prompts/commands/prime_project_context_with_mcp.md`
   - Paste it into your Windsurf chat
   - The AI will use `git` MCP to understand your project and `memory` MCP to remember it

2. **Plan new features** before you build
   - Use `.windsurf_prompts/commands/draft_feature_spec_with_mcp.md`
   - Explain what you want to build
   - The AI will use `tavily` to research, `fetch` to get docs, and help write a detailed plan

3. **Build your app** with the AI as your coding buddy
   - The AI now has context about your project and a plan
   - It can help write code, debug issues, and explain concepts

### Folder Breakdown

- `ai_docs/` = Documentation the AI can understand (API details, architecture)
- `specs/` = Feature specifications (what you're building and how)
- `.windsurf_prompts/` = Templates for working with Windsurf

## What's Missing?

- Your actual code! This is just a skeleton - you'll add a `src/` folder when you start coding
- Your creativity and domain knowledge (AI can't replace that... yet ðŸ‘€)
- Possibly some domain-specific templates you might want to add

## Pro Tips (no cap fr fr)

- Always give your AI clear instructions - it's smart but not psychic
- Update docs as you go - future you will thank you
- Use `memory` MCP to store key decisions so the AI remembers them
- Be specific about API details when asking for implementation help

Happy hacking fren ^__^

Don't get haxd!
