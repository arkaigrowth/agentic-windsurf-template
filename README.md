# HOW TO USE THIS REPO

Alas... you've watched YT videos until your eyes hurt, and you've made it to fully automated luxury agentic software development (just mind your API U$$$AGE!! üò¨)

## The TL;DR

This repo gives you a ready-to-roll project structure for building apps with AI assistance. It's like pair programming, but your partner is an AI that actually knows what it's doing.

### Repo Structure

- `.ai_docs/` = Professor Pelican's Library üìö - Documentation the AI can understand (API details, architecture, technical details)
- `specs/` = Captain Clipboard's Plans üìã - Feature specifications (what you're building and how)
- `.windsurf/` = Windsurf Bro's Board Rack üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è - Templates and rules for working with Windsurf
- `src/` = Source code for your project (not yet created - you'll add this as you build)

## Quick Setup (no cap)

1. **Clone this repo** to your machine (or just copy these folders)
2. **Rename everything** from "my_windsurf_project" to whatever your actual project is called
3. **Set up your global rules** to include commands that will automatically set up these agentic folders (`.ai_docs/`, `specs/`, `.windsurf/`) in any repo
   - **Recommended**: Add template commands to `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md`
   - You can edit these via Cascade menu: Customizations > Rules > +Global
   - Include commands like `setup-agent-workspace` to copy template folders to any workspace
   - **For detailed instructions, see the [Setup Guide](setup_windsurf_rules_guide.md)**
     - **NOTE**: You can use the [Setup Script](setup_windsurf_rules.sh) to automatically configure your `~/.codeium/windsurf/memories/global_rules.md` with these agentic repo setup commands
4. **Set up your Windsurf config** to use those MCP servers (if you haven't already)
   - Make sure your mcp_config.json is good to go (see MCP Configuration section below)
   - Double-check your API keys aren't expired
5. **Configure repo-based rules** according to your project's specific needs
   - Create `.windsurf/rules/*.md` file in your project
   - See [Windsurf Rules Documentation](.windsurf/README.md) for detailed instructions and examples of global and repo-based rules.

## MCP Configuration - The Secret Sauce üå∂Ô∏è

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is what gives your AI assistant superpowers - it lets the AI interact with tools and services outside its normal sandbox. No cap, it's a game-changer!

### What's the vibe with MCP

- MCP servers are like plugins that let your AI do things it normally can't (search the web, access your git repo, remember stuff long-term)
- Each server has a specific job (like `tavily` for web search or `git` for repo access)
- The AI triggers these tools with specific phrases like "search the web for React hooks (use tavily)" or "git.log -n 5"

### How to set it up

1. Check out the `example_mcp_config.jsonc` file in this repo
2. Copy it to your Windsurf config location (usually `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`)
3. Replace the placeholder API keys with your actual keys
4. For memory storage, set the paths to where you want data stored

```json
// Example for the tavily search MCP
"tavily": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "tavily-mcp@latest"],
  "env": { "TAVILY_API_KEY": "<YOUR_TAVILY_API_KEY>" }
}
```

Most MCP servers work right out of the box with npx, but some (like memory) need a bit more setup.

### The coolest MCPs to use with this project

- `git`: Helps the AI understand your codebase and commit history
- `memory`: Lets the AI remember important project details between sessions
- `tavily`: Searches the web for docs and solutions
- `fetch`: Grabs content from URLs and formats it nicely
- `figma`: Connects to your design files for implementing UI/UX
- `postgres`: Understands your database schema (when working with PostgreSQL)
- `browser`: Controls a headless browser for testing and automation
- `puppeteer`: Controls a headless browser for testing and automation

## How to Actually Use This Thing (the Workflow Vibe Check)

1. **Prime your AI** with project context

   - Mention the template from `.windsurf/workflows/prime_project_context_with_mcp.md` in Cascade. (e.g. 'refer to @prime_project_context_with_mcp to get context about this project')
   - The AI will use `git` MCP to list files and understand commit history
   - It will use `memory` MCP to store project understanding for future sessions
2. **Plan new features** before you build

   - Use `.windsurf/workflows/draft_feature_spec_with_mcp.md`
   - Explain what you want to build
   - The AI will use `tavily` to research, `fetch` to get docs, and help write a detailed plan
   - Add the possibility of using `postgres` MCP for database schema understanding
   - Leverage `figma` MCP for design information when relevant
3. **Build your app** with the AI as your coding buddy

   - The AI now has context about your project and a plan
   - It can help write code, debug issues, and explain concepts
   - Follow the plans created in previous steps
4. **Document as you go**

   - Update documentation in `.ai_docs/` to capture key decisions and implementation details
   - This ensures both you and the AI have up-to-date context in future sessions
   - Use `memory` MCP to store particularly important insights

## What's Missing?

- Your actual code! This is just a skeleton - you'll add a `src/` folder when you start coding
- Your creativity and domain knowledge (AI can't replace that... yet üëÄ)
- Possibly some domain-specific templates you might want to add

## Pro Tips (no cap fr fr)

- Always give your AI clear instructions - it's smart but not psychic
- Update docs as you go - future you will thank you
- Use `memory` MCP to store key decisions so the AI remembers them
- Be specific about API details when asking for implementation help

Happy hacking fren ^__^

Don't get haxd!
