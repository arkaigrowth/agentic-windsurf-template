# Feature Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for features and components in the `agentic_project`.

## Purpose
These specifications serve as the blueprint for implementation, ensuring:
- Clear requirements are defined before development begins
- All stakeholders have a shared understanding of the feature
- Implementation details are thoughtfully planned
- Dependencies and integrations are identified early

## For Developers
When implementing a feature:
1. Start by reviewing the corresponding specification
2. Use it as a checklist to ensure complete implementation
3. Note any deviations or challenges encountered during implementation
4. Update the specification if requirements change during development

## For Product Managers
When creating a new specification:
1. Use the `template_feature_specification.md` as a starting point
2. Fill in all sections with relevant details
3. Seek feedback from development and design teams
4. Finalize the specification before development begins

## Note on AI Assistance
AI assistants, using tools like the `tavily` and `fetch` MCP servers, can help research and draft these initial specifications. This approach combines AI's research capabilities with human domain expertise for comprehensive feature planning.
